## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application follows a standard client-server architecture:

1.  **React Native Client:** The mobile app handles user interaction, including login, image uploads, and displaying the wardrobe.
2.  **Node.js Backend API:** A RESTful API built with Express that serves as the brain of the application. It handles business logic, communicates with the database, and integrates with third-party services.
3.  **MongoDB Database:** A NoSQL database used to store user information and wardrobe item details.
4.  **Google Cloud Vision:** An external AI service used for analyzing and labeling images.
5.  **Firebase:** An external service used for handling user authentication securely.
